    Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing
or searching unweighted graph data structures. It explores 
as far as possible along a branch and then backtracks when 
it can't go any further. The algorithm visits a node and 
then recursively visits all nodes reachable from that node, 
marking each visited node to avoid visiting it again, before 
backtracking.
