                    GREEDY-BEST FIRST SEARCH
    Greedy best search is an algorithm we made up as a result of 
trying to improve the depth-first search algorithm in a similar 
way to the development of the A* algorithm by making additions to 
the Dijkstra algorithm.
    Unlike the depth-first search, the algorithm traverses in a 
direction that minimizes the Manhattan distance to the target instead 
of traversing fixed instructions. Like depth-first search, it doesn't 
work on weighted graphs nor guarantee to find the shortest path.
