    A* is a search algorithm that is used to find the shortest 
path between two nodes in a graph. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, 
which finds the shortest path to all nodes, A* only calculates 
the shortest path to the destination node.
    A* combines the strengths of two other algorithms, Dijkstra's 
algorithm and a heuristic search algorithm. A heuristic function 
is used to estimate the cost of reaching the destination node from 
a given node. This estimate is combined with the actual cost of 
reaching that node from the source node, to create a cost estimate 
for reaching the destination node. The algorithm selects the node 
with the lowest cost estimate to visit next, and continues until 
the destination node is reached or there are no more nodes to visit.
    The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm, meaning it uses 
additional information about the problem to search more efficiently. 
The heuristic function must be an admissible heuristic, meaning it 
must never overestimate the cost of reaching the destination node, 
in order for the algorithm to guarantee the shortest path.
