                                DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
    Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that 
finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes 
in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by maintaining a set 
of vertices for which the shortest distance from the source node 
is known, and repeatedly selecting the vertex with the lowest 
known distance and updating the distances of its neighbors. The 
algorithm terminates when the destination node has been processed, 
or when all vertices have been processed. The final result is a set 
of distances from the source node to all other nodes, and the shortest 
path can be reconstructed by tracing back through the processed 
vertices.
